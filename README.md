# code-preview.nvim

A Neovim plugin that shows a **diff preview before your AI coding agent applies any file change** — letting you review exactly what's changing before accepting.

Supports [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli), and [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) as backends.

## Features

- **Diff preview** — side-by-side or inline diff opens in Neovim before any file is written
- **Multiple layouts** — tab, vsplit, or GitHub-style inline diff with syntax highlighting
- **Neo-tree integration** — file tree indicators show which files are being modified, created, or deleted
- **Multi-backend** — works with Claude Code, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and OpenAI Codex CLI
- **No Python dependency** — file transformations use `nvim --headless -l`

---

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.10

**For Claude Code backend:**
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with hooks support
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — for JSON parsing in hook scripts

**For OpenCode backend:**
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) >= 1.3.0

**For GitHub Copilot CLI backend:**
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) (generally available since Feb 2026)

**For OpenAI Codex CLI backend:**
- [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (recent enough to support `apply_patch` PreToolUse hooks; older builds only fired hooks for `Bash`)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — for hook payload translation

---

## Installation

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  "Cannon07/code-preview.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("code-preview").setup()
  end,
}
```

### Manual (path-based)

```lua
vim.opt.rtp:prepend("/path/to/code-preview.nvim")
require("code-preview").setup()
```

---

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

1. Install the plugin and call `setup()`
2. Open a project in Neovim
3. Run `:CodePreviewInstallClaudeCodeHooks` — writes hooks to `.claude/settings.local.json`
4. Restart Claude Code CLI in the project directory
5. Ask Claude to edit a file — a diff opens automatically in Neovim
6. Accept/reject in the CLI; the diff closes automatically on accept
7. If rejected, press `<leader>dq` to close the diff manually

### OpenCode

1. Install the plugin and call `setup()`
2. Open a project in Neovim
3. Run `:CodePreviewInstallOpenCodeHooks` — copies the plugin to `.opencode/plugins/`
4. Ensure your OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) has permission prompts enabled:
   ```json
   {
     "permission": {
       "edit": "ask",
       "bash": "ask"
     }
   }
   ```
5. Start OpenCode in the project directory
6. Ask OpenCode to edit a file — a diff opens automatically in Neovim
7. Accept/reject in OpenCode; the diff closes automatically on accept
8. If rejected, press `<leader>dq` to close the diff manually

### GitHub Copilot CLI

1. Install the plugin and call `setup()`
2. Open a project in Neovim
3. Run `:CodePreviewInstallCopilotCliHooks` — writes `.github/hooks/code-preview.json`
4. Start Copilot CLI in the project directory
5. Ask Copilot to edit a file — a diff opens automatically in Neovim
6. Accept/reject in the CLI; the diff closes automatically on accept
7. If rejected, press `<leader>dq` to close the diff manually

> **Note:** Copilot CLI does not fire post-tool hooks on rejection, so rejected diffs remain open until you dismiss them (same as Claude Code).

### OpenAI Codex CLI

1. Install the plugin and call `setup()`
2. Open a project in Neovim
3. Run `:CodePreviewInstallCodexCliHooks` — writes `.codex/hooks.json`
4. The diff-preview workflow only makes sense when Codex asks before applying edits. Create or edit `.codex/config.toml` (project-local) or `~/.codex/config.toml` (global) and add:

   ```toml
   approval_policy = "on-request"
   sandbox_mode    = "read-only"
   ```

   `approval_policy = "on-request"` and `sandbox_mode = "read-only"` ensure Codex prompts you before every edit, so the diff preview has time to open and you have time to review. Without them, Codex may apply changes without prompting and the preview window will never block on your decision.

   > **Note on the hooks feature flag:** Modern Codex enables hooks by default — no `[features]` entry is required. If you previously disabled them with `[features] hooks = false` (or the legacy `codex_hooks = false`), remove that line. `:CodePreviewStatus` and `:checkhealth code-preview` will warn if hooks are explicitly disabled.
5. Start Codex CLI in the project directory
6. Ask Codex to edit a file — a diff opens automatically in Neovim
7. Accept/reject in the CLI; the diff closes automatically on accept
8. If rejected, press `<leader>dq` to close the diff manually

> **Note:** Today's Codex models route all file edits through the `apply_patch` tool. New file creation that Codex performs via shell redirection (e.g. `printf … > foo.txt`) is not previewed — only `apply_patch` and edits via the dedicated `Edit`/`Write` tools (when emitted) are.

## How it works

```
AI Agent (terminal)                              Neovim
        |                                          |
   Proposes an Edit                                |
        |                                          |
   Hook/plugin fires ──→ compute diff ──→ RPC → show_diff()
        |                                          | (side-by-side or inline)
   CLI: "Accept? (y/n)"                            |
        |                                     User reviews diff
   User accepts/rejects                            |
        |                                          |
   Post hook fires ────→ cleanup ─────→ RPC → close_diff()
```

**Claude Code** uses shell-based hooks (`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`) configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`.

**OpenCode** uses a TypeScript plugin (`tool.execute.before`/`tool.execute.after`) loaded from `.opencode/plugins/`.

**GitHub Copilot CLI** uses shell-based hooks (`preToolUse`/`postToolUse`) configured in `.github/hooks/code-preview.json`. The adapter translates Copilot's tool vocabulary (`apply_patch`, `edit`, `create`, `bash`) into the same normalized format used by the other backends.

**OpenAI Codex CLI** uses shell-based hooks (`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`) configured in `.codex/hooks.json`. Hooks are enabled by default in modern Codex; the only way to silence them is `[features] hooks = false` (or the legacy `codex_hooks = false`) in `.codex/config.toml`. The adapter passes `Bash` through and rewrites `apply_patch` (whose patch text lives in `tool_input.command`) into the canonical `ApplyPatch` shape with `tool_input.patch_text`.

All backends communicate with Neovim via RPC (`nvim --server <socket> --remote-send`).

---

## Configuration

All options with defaults:

```lua
require("code-preview").setup({
  debug = false,         -- enable debug logging to stdpath("log")/code-preview.log
  diff = {
    layout   = "tab",    -- "tab" (new tab) | "vsplit" (current tab) | "inline" (GitHub-style)
    labels   = { current = "CURRENT", proposed = "PROPOSED" },
    equalize   = true,   -- 50/50 split widths (tab/vsplit only)
    full_file  = true,   -- show full file, not just diff hunks (tab/vsplit only)
    visible_only = false, -- skip diffs for files not open in any Neovim buffer
    defer_claude_permissions = false, -- for Claude Code: let its own settings decide, don't prompt
  },
  highlights = {
    current = {          -- CURRENT (original) side — tab/vsplit layouts
      DiffAdd    = { bg = "#4c2e2e" },
      DiffDelete = { bg = "#4c2e2e" },
      DiffChange = { bg = "#4c3a2e" },
      DiffText   = { bg = "#5c3030" },
    },
    proposed = {         -- PROPOSED side — tab/vsplit layouts
      DiffAdd    = { bg = "#2e4c2e" },
      DiffDelete = { bg = "#4c2e2e" },
      DiffChange = { bg = "#2e3c4c" },
      DiffText   = { bg = "#3e5c3e" },
    },
    inline = {           -- inline layout
      added        = { bg = "#2e4c2e" },          -- added line background
      removed      = { bg = "#4c2e2e" },          -- removed line background
      added_text   = { bg = "#3a6e3a" },          -- changed characters (added)
      removed_text = { bg = "#6e3a3a" },          -- changed characters (removed)
    },
  },
})
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `:CodePreviewInstallClaudeCodeHooks` | Install Claude Code hooks to `.claude/settings.local.json` |
| `:CodePreviewUninstallClaudeCodeHooks` | Remove Claude Code hooks (leaves other hooks intact) |
| `:CodePreviewInstallOpenCodeHooks` | Install OpenCode plugin to `.opencode/plugins/` |
| `:CodePreviewUninstallOpenCodeHooks` | Remove OpenCode plugin |
| `:CodePreviewInstallCopilotCliHooks` | Install Copilot CLI hooks to `.github/hooks/code-preview.json` |
| `:CodePreviewUninstallCopilotCliHooks` | Remove Copilot CLI hooks |
| `:CodePreviewInstallCodexCliHooks` | Install Codex CLI hooks to `.codex/hooks.json` |
| `:CodePreviewUninstallCodexCliHooks` | Remove Codex CLI hooks |
| `:CodePreviewCloseDiff` | Manually close the diff (use after rejecting a change) |
| `:CodePreviewStatus` | Show socket path, hook status, and dependency check |
| `:CodePreviewToggleVisibleOnly` | Toggle visible_only — show diffs only for open buffers |
| `:checkhealth code-preview` | Full health check (all backends) |

## Keymaps

| Key | Scope | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `<leader>dq` | global | Close the diff (same as `:CodePreviewCloseDiff`) |
| `]c` | inline diff buffer | Jump to next change |
| `[c` | inline diff buffer | Jump to previous change |

All defaults are configurable via `setup()`:

```lua
require("code-preview").setup({
  keys = {
    next_change = "]c",          -- inline diff: next change
    prev_change = "[c",          -- inline diff: previous change
    close_all   = "<leader>dq",  -- close diff and clear indicators
  },
})
```

Set any entry to `false` to skip that binding, or `keys = false` to skip them all. A `<Plug>(CodePreviewCloseAll)` mapping is always defined, so you can bind it yourself even with `keys = false`:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>x", "<Plug>(CodePreviewCloseAll)")
```

---

## Diff Layouts

code-preview supports three diff layouts, configured via `diff.layout`:

| Layout | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `"tab"` (default) | Side-by-side diff in a new tab — CURRENT on the left, PROPOSED on the right |
| `"vsplit"` | Side-by-side diff as a vertical split in the current tab |
| `"inline"` | GitHub-style unified diff in a single buffer with syntax highlighting preserved |

### Inline diff features

- **Syntax highlighting** — the file's language highlighting is preserved
- **Character-level diffs** — changed portions within a line are highlighted with a brighter background
- **Sign column** — `+`/`-` signs indicate added/removed lines
- **Navigation** — `]c` / `[c` to jump between changes

To use inline diff:

```lua
require("code-preview").setup({
  diff = { layout = "inline" },
})
```

---

## Neo-tree Integration (Optional)

If you use [neo-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim), code-preview will automatically decorate your file tree with visual indicators when changes are proposed. No extra configuration is required — it works out of the box.

![neo-tree integration demo](docs/code-preview-neotree-integration.gif)

### What you get

| Status | Icon | Name Color | Description |
|--------|------|------------|-------------|
| Modified | 󰏫 | Orange | An existing file is being edited |
| Created | 󰎔 | Cyan + italic | A new file is being created (shown as a virtual node) |
| Deleted | 󰆴 | Red + strikethrough | A file is being deleted via `rm` |

Additional behaviors:
- **Auto-reveal** — the tree expands to highlight the changed file
- **Virtual nodes** — new files/directories appear in the tree before they exist on disk
- **Clean focus** — git status, diagnostics, and modified indicators are temporarily hidden while changes are pending
- **Auto-cleanup** — all indicators clear when you accept, reject, or press `<leader>dq`

### Neo-tree configuration options

All neo-tree options with defaults:

```lua
require("code-preview").setup({
  neo_tree = {
    enabled = true,             -- set false to disable neo-tree integration
    reveal = true,              -- auto-reveal changed files in the tree
    reveal_root = "cwd",        -- "cwd" (current working dir) or "git" (git root)
    position = "right",         -- neo-tree window position: "left", "right", "float"
    symbols = {
      modified = "󰏫",
      created  = "󰎔",
      deleted  = "󰆴",
    },
    highlights = {
      modified = { fg = "#e8a838", bold = true },
      created  = { fg = "#56c8d8", bold = true },
      deleted  = { fg = "#e06c75", bold = true, strikethrough = true },
    },
  },
})
```

> **Note:** Neo-tree is a soft dependency. If neo-tree is not installed, the plugin works exactly as before — only the diff preview.

## Testing

The test suite uses [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) for core plugin tests and shell scripts for backend integration tests. CI runs on both Ubuntu and macOS.

```bash
./tests/run.sh                          # all tests (plugin + backends)
./tests/run.sh plugin                   # core plugin tests only (plenary busted)
./tests/run.sh backends                 # all backend integration tests
./tests/run.sh backends/claudecode      # Claude Code backend only
./tests/run.sh backends/opencode        # OpenCode backend only
./tests/run.sh backends/copilot         # GitHub Copilot CLI backend only
./tests/run.sh backends/codex           # OpenAI Codex CLI backend only
```

**Dependencies:** Neovim >= 0.10, jq, bun (for OpenCode tests). Plenary is auto-installed to `deps/` on first run.

---

## Recommended companion settings

For buffers to auto-reload after a file is written, add this to your Neovim config:

```lua
vim.o.autoread = true
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "FocusGained", "BufEnter", "CursorHold" }, {
  command = "checktime",
})
```
---

## Troubleshooting

**Diff doesn't open**
- Run `:CodePreviewStatus` — check that `Neovim socket` is found
- Run `:checkhealth code-preview` — check for missing dependencies
- Enable debug logging (`debug = true` in setup) and check `~/.local/state/nvim/code-preview.log`
- Restart the CLI agent after installing hooks (hooks are read at startup)

**Claude Code hooks not firing**
- Run `:CodePreviewInstallClaudeCodeHooks` in the project root
- Verify `.claude/settings.local.json` contains the hook entries
- Ensure `jq` is in PATH
- Restart Claude Code CLI

**OpenCode plugin not loading**
- Run `:CodePreviewInstallOpenCodeHooks` in the project root
- Verify `.opencode/plugins/index.ts` exists
- Ensure `"permission": { "edit": "ask" }` is set in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
- Restart OpenCode

**Codex CLI hooks not firing**
- Run `:CodePreviewInstallCodexCliHooks` in the project root
- Confirm `.codex/config.toml` does **not** contain `[features] hooks = false` (or the legacy `codex_hooks = false`) — hooks are enabled by default in modern Codex; an explicit `false` is the only way to silence them
- Update Codex if needed — older versions required `codex_hooks = true` explicitly and only fired hooks for `Bash`, not `apply_patch`
- Run `:CodePreviewStatus` and `:checkhealth code-preview` to verify install state and the feature flag

**Copilot CLI hooks not firing**
- Run `:CodePreviewInstallCopilotCliHooks` in the project root
- Verify `.github/hooks/code-preview.json` exists
- Ensure `jq` is in PATH
- Restart Copilot CLI (hooks are loaded at session start)

**Diff doesn't close after rejecting**
- Press `<leader>dq` or run `:CodePreviewCloseDiff` — the post hook only fires on accept

**Migrating from older versions**
- Update `require("claude-preview")` to `require("code-preview")` in your Neovim config
- Re-run `:CodePreviewInstallClaudeCodeHooks` to update hook paths
- The old `:ClaudePreview*` commands have been removed — use the `:CodePreview*` equivalents
